#Page1Line1-0#		Grandma's garden was wonderful -|| full of
#Page1Line1-1#		sorghum, millet, and cassava.| But best
#Page1Line1-2#		of all were the bananas.
#Page1Time1#		10.6
#Page1Line2-0#		Although Grandma had many grandchildren,| I
#Page1Line2-1#		secretly knew that I was her favourite.
#Page1Time2#		6.8
#Page1Line3-0#		She invited me often to her house.||
#Page1Line3-1#		She also told me little secrets.
#Page1Time3#		6.6
#Page1Line4-0#		But there was one secret she did not share
#Page1Line4-1#		with me:|| where she ripened bananas.
#Page1Time4#		7.5

#Page2Line1-0#		One day I saw a big straw basket placed in the
#Page2Line1-1#		sun outside Grandma's house.
#Page2Time1#		7.0
#Page2Line2-0#		When I asked what it was for, the only answer I
#Page2Line2-1#		got was,| "It's my magic basket."
#Page2Time2#		7.2
#Page2Line3-0#		Next to the basket,| there were several banana
#Page2Line3-1#		leaves that Grandma turned from time to time.
#Page2Time3#		6.8
#Page2Line4-0#		I was curious.|| "What are the leaves for,|
#Page2Line4-1#		Grandma?" I asked.
#Page2Time4#		6.2
#Page2Line5-0#		The only answer I got was,| "They are my
#Page2Line5-1#		magic leaves."
#Page2Time5#		4.4
 
##Page 3
#Page3Line1-0#	It was so interesting watching Grandma,| the
#Page3Line1-1#	bananas,| the banana leaves and the big straw basket.
#Page3Time1#		7.9
#Page3Line2#		But Grandma sent me off to my mother on an errand.
#Page3Time2#		3.85
#Page3Line3-0#	"Grandma,| please, let me watch as you prepare..."|
#Page3Line3-1#	"Don't be stubborn child, do as you are told,"|
#Page3Line3-2#	she insisted.
#Page3Time3#		10
#Page3Line4#		I took off running.
#Page3Time4#		1.2
 
##Page 4
#Page4Line1-0#		When I returned,| Grandma was sitting outside but
#Page4Line1-1#		neither the basket nor the bananas.
#Page4Time1#		7.0
#Page4Line2-0#		"Grandma,| where is the basket,| where are all the
#Page4Line2-1#		bananas, and where...".
#Page4Time2#		5.6
#Page4Line3-0#		But the only answer I got was,| "They are in my
#Page4Line3-1#		magic place."
#Page4Time3#		5.9
#Page4Line4#		It was so disappointing!
#Page4Time4#		2.8
 
##Page 5
#Page5Line1-0#		Two days later,| Grandma sent me to fetch her
#Page5Line1-1#		walking stick from her bedroom.
#Page5Time1#		6.1
#Page5Line2-0#		As soon as I opened the door,| I was welcomed by
#Page5Line2-1#		the strong smell of ripening bananas.
#Page5Time2#		8.0
#Page5Line3-0#		In the inner room was grandma's big magic straw
#Page5Line3-1#		basket.| It was well hidden by an old blanket.
#Page5Time3#		8.6
#Page5Line4#		I lifted it and sniffed that glorious smell.
#Page5Time4#		4.2
 
##Page 6
#Page6Line1-0#		Grandma's voice startled me when she called,|
#Page6Line1-1#		"What are you doing? Hurry up and bring me the stick."
#Page6Time1#		7.1
#Page6Line2-0#		I hurried out with her walking stick.||
#Page6Line2-1#		"What are you smiling about?" Grandma asked.
#Page6Time2#		7.3
#Page6Line4-0#		Her question made me realise that I was still
#Page6Line4-1#		smiling at the discovery of her magic place.
#Page6Time4#		6.0
 
##Page 7
#Page7Line1-0#		The following day when grandma came to visit my
#Page7Line1-1#		mother, I rushed to her house to check the bananas once more.
#Page7Time1#		7.7
#Page7Line2-0#		There was a bunch of very ripe ones.||
#Page7Line2-1#		I picked one and hid it in my dress.
#Page7Time2#		8.0
#Page7Line3-0#		After covering the basket again, I went behind
#Page7Line3-1#		the house and quickly ate it.|
#Page7Line3-2#		It was the sweetest banana I had ever tasted.
#Page7Time3#		11.2
 
##Page 8
#Page8Line1-0#		The following day, when grandma was in the garden
#Page8Line1-1#		picking vegetables,| I sneaked in and peered at the
#Page8Line1-2#		bananas.| Nearly all were ripe.
#Page8Time1#		11.3
#Page8Line2-0#		I couldn't help taking a bunch of four.||
#Page8Line2-1#		As I tiptoed towards the door,| I heard
#Page8Line2-2#		grandma coughing outside.
#Page8Time2#		8.8
#Page8Line3-0#		I just managed to hide the bananas under my
#Page8Line3-1#		dress as I walked past her.
#Page8Time3#		4.5
 
##Page 9
#Page9Line1-0#		The following day was market day.|
#Page9Line1-1#		Grandma woke up early.
#Page9Time1#		5.1
#Page9Line2-0#		She always took ripe bananas and the cassava
#Page9Line2-1#		to sell at the market.
#Page9Time2#		5.1
#Page9Line3-0#		I did not hurry to visit her that day.|
#Page9Line3-1#		But I could not avoid her for long.
#Page9Time3#		6.2
 
##Page 10
#Page10Line1-0#		Later that evening I was called by my mother and
#Page10Line1-1#		father,| and Grandma.|| I knew why.
#Page10Time1#		8.3
#Page10Line2-0#		That night as I lay down to sleep,| I knew I could
#Page10Line2-1#		never steal again,|| not from grandma, not from my
#Page10Line2-2#		parents, and certainly not from anyone else.
#Page10Time2#		13.7
