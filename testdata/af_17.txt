##Page 1
#Page1Line1-0#		Once upon a time,| when there were no
#Page1Line1-1#		people,| God looked down at the beautiful world he had made.
#Page1Time1#		6.9
#Page1Line2-0#		He thought| I must have someone to look after my
#Page1Line2-1#		creation.
#Page1Time2#		3.76
 
##Page 2
#Page2Line1-0#		The lion roared,| "I am the king of the jungle, I
#Page2Line1-1#		can look after the world."
#Page2Time1#		5.2
 
##Page 3
#Page3Line1-0#		The elephant trumpeted loudly,| "My Lord, you have
#Page3Line1-1#		made me so big and majestic."
#Page3Time1#		6.7
#Page3Line2#		"Surely I am right for the job."
#Page3Time2#		1.9
 
##Page 4
#Page4Line1-0#		The whale looked up at the sky and spouted a
#Page4Line1-1#		fountain of water,| "Do they know how to swim and 
#Page4Line1-2#		look after the fish, the reefs, the coral and
#Page4Line1-3#		millions of tiny sea animals?".
#Page4Time1#		11.15
#Page4Line2-0#		"I can look after the oceans.|| "I can also keep
#Page4Line2-1#		my head above water and see what is going on|
#Page4Line2-2#		on the land."
#Page4Time2#		8.54
#Page4Line3-0#		"I am so LARGE, no one will dare to do anything
#Page4Line3-1#		against your will."
#Page4Time3#		4.7
 
##Page 5
#Page5Line1-0#		The shark thought his sharp teeth were all that
#Page5Line1-1#		were needed to do the job.
#Page5Time1#		5.35
 
##Page 6
#Page6Line1-0#		The eagle laughed,| "These animals can only look
#Page6Line1-1#		after those on land, while the whale and the shark
#Page6Line1-2#		can only see the water animals."
#Page6Time1#		8.72
#Page6Line2-0#		"But I fly, I see the land, sky and water.||
#Page6Line2-1#		I am the only one fit to be the keeper of
#Page6Line2-2#		the world."
#Page6Time2#		8.4
 
##Page 7
#Page7Line1-0#		God listened carefully to the animals, to the
#Page7Line1-1#		fish and the birds.|| "I will create man," he said.
#Page7Time1#		6.95
#Page7Line2-0#		The animals all wondered,| what was this
#Page7Line2-1#		thing called "man".|| What colour, with feathers
#Page7Line2-2#		or fur, or scales?
#Page7Time2#		7.95
#Page7Line3-0#		Will he run like a lion?| Swim like a fish?
#Page7Line3-1#		Fly high like the eagle?
#Page7Time3#		5.25
 
##Page 8
#Page8Line1#		The sun had set and it was night.
#Page8Time1#		1.8
#Page8Line2-0#		He wrapped himself in the night sky,| put the
#Page8Line2-1#		twinkle of stars into the eyes and used the
#Page8Line2-2#		black clouds for hair.
#Page8Time2#		6.95
#Page8Line3-0#		He also put pieces of the moon in nails and
#Page8Line3-1#		the shine of far away stars in teeth.
#Page8Time3#		5.15
#Page8Line4-0#		So the first man and woman were created with
#Page8Line4-1#		shiny black skins like the night.
#Page8Time4#		4.25
 
##Page 9
#Page9Line1#		Soon the night faded and it was morning.
#Page9Time1#		2.65
#Page9Line2-0#		God covered himself in the white morning light,
#Page9Line2-1#		took the blue sky for the eyes, the gold of the
#Page9Line2-2#		sun he spun into hair, and before him stood a man
#Page9Line2-3#		and woman with white skins, blue eyes and golden hair.
#Page9Time2#		13.72
 
##Page 10
#Page10Line1#		Now the morning had turned into afternoon.
#Page10Time1#		2.45
#Page10Line2-0#		The sun was very bright, so he pulled the yellow
#Page10Line2-1#		light, and the deep black shadows of the afternoon and
#Page10Line2-2#		made a man and woman with yellow skins, black hair and
#Page10Line2-3#		eyes that slanted to look into the sun.
#Page10Time2#		14.15
 
##Page 11
#Page11Line1-0#		It was now evening, the sky had become dusky and
#Page11Line1-1#		a few stars had also appeared in the sky.
#Page11Time1#		6.3
#Page11Line2-0#		God looked down and saw the beautiful rich brown
#Page11Line2-1#		of the earth and the dusk of the sky for the skin.
#Page11Time2#		6.1
#Page11Line3-0#		The black colour of the night was for the hair
#Page11Line3-1#		and he used the sparkle of the stars for the eyes.
#Page11Time3#		5.56
#Page11Line4-0#		Before him stood a man and woman with brown
#Page11Line4-1#		skins, black hair and eyes.
#Page11Time4#		5.15
 
##Page 12
#Page12Line1-0#		The animals all looked in wonder at the strange
#Page12Line1-1#		creature who stood on two legs, with naked skin,
#Page12Line1-2#		with no fur or feathers or even scales.
#Page12Time1#		9.2
#Page12Line2-0#		The lion looked down his kingly nose and roared,
#Page12Line2-1#		"I can outrun them and with a swipe of my paw I
#Page12Line2-2#		can kill them,| sorry for saying so."
#Page12Time2#		8.93
 
##Page 13
#Page13Line1-0#		Zebra suggested, "Some stripes would have
#Page13Line1-1#		improved their look."
#Page13Time1#		4.2
#Page13Line2#		The leopard said, "A few spots."
#Page13Time2#		2.1
#Page13Line3-0#		The elephant trumpeted, "Surely grey would have
#Page13Line3-1#		been a better colour?"
#Page13Time3#		4.0
 
##Page 14
#Page14Line1-0#		The shark looked at their teeth and smiled
#Page14Line1-1#		showing his sharp teeth.
#Page14Time1#		4.4
#Page14Line2-0#		"Ah! No fins, how will they swim? And they are
#Page14Line2-1#		going to be the keeper.|| Ha! Ha! Ha!".
#Page14Time2#		7.0
#Page14Line3-0#		The fish,| big and small, laughed as they dived
#Page14Line3-1#		into the deep water leaving a trail of bubbles
#Page14Line3-2#		of laughter.
#Page14Time3#		6.8
 
##Page 15
#Page15Line1-0#		God smiled kindly, "You see, to survive, man will
#Page15Line1-1#		have to look after the animals, the oceans with all
#Page15Line1-2#		their life, the plants, from the tiniest to the
#Page15Line1-3#		largest trees."
#Page15Time1#		11.4
#Page15Line2-0#		"The day he starts destroying the world with his
#Page15Line2-1#		greed, he will be destroyed."
#Page15Time2#		4.7
#Page15Line3-0#		The animals,| the fish and the birds bowed their
#Page15Line3-1#		heads and hoped they would be safe.
#Page15Time3#		5.35
#Page15Line4-0#		So let us,| YOU and I,| look after this wonderful
#Page15Line4-1#		world.
