##Page 1
#Page1Line1-0#  Hyena and Raven were once great friends,|
#Page1Line1-1#  even though they were quite different in many ways.
#Page1Time1#		7.7
#Page1Line2#    Raven could fly but Hyena was only able to walk.
#Page1Time2#		4.4

##Page 2
#Page2Line1-0#  One day| Hyena,| curious to know    
#Page2Line1-1#  something about his friend,| asked Raven,|  
#Page2Line1-2#  "What is this white thing which is always below your neck?"
#Page2Time1#		10.8

##Page 3
#Page3Line1-0#  Raven answered,| "It is the fatty meat which I usually eat in the sky.|
#Page3Line1-1#  I have been eating it for so long now it is stuck onto my neck."
#Page3Time1#		9.6
#Page3Line2-0#  On hearing about the meat,| saliva started pouring out of Hyena's
#Page3Line2-1#  mouth for he was greedy and he loved meat very much.
#Page3Time2#		12.2
#Page3Line3-0#  Hyena really wanted to eat that meat.|| But how could he
#Page3Line3-1#  reach the meat in the sky if he had no wings to fly?
#Page3Time3#		9.7
#Page3Line4-0#  "Please my friend,"| he asked Raven,| "lend me some feathers so that I
#Page3Line4-1#  can make myself some wings.| I really want to be able to fly like you."
#Page3Time4#		10.5

##Page 4
#Page4Line1-0#  Raven was not mean,| so he gave him some feathers.|
#Page4Line1-1#  Hyena sewed them together into wings.
#Page4Time1#		7.0
#Page4Line2-0#  He fastened them around his body,| and
#Page4Line2-1#  tried to take off into the sky.
#Page4Time2#		4.8
#Page4Line3-0#  But he was far too heavy for a few feathers to carry him.|
#Page4Line3-1#  So he had to think of another plan.
#Page4Time3#		8.3

##Page 5
#Page5Line1-0#  "Please my friend,|" he asked Raven,| "could I hold
#Page5Line1-1#  onto your tail as you fly up into the sky?"
#Page5Time1#		6.7
#Page5Line2-0#  "All right,|" said Raven.| "I know how much you
#Page5Line2-1#  want to fly.| Let's do it tomorrow morning."
#Page5Time2#		6.7
#Page5Line3-0#  When day came,| Hyena took hold of Raven's tail
#Page5Line3-1#  and Raven flew up into the sky.
#Page5Time3#		6.9

##Page 6
#Page6Line1-0#  Raven flew| and flew| and flew| until he was exhausted.|
#Page6Line1-1#  But Hyena said,| "Just a little further,| my friend!"
#Page6Time1#		10.1
#Page6Line2-0#  He could see the white and fatty meat just above them,|
#Page6Line2-1#  and his mouth was watering.
#Page6Time2#		3.0

##Page 7
#Page7Line1-0#  When they reached the first piece of fatty meat, Hyena felt a jerk. 
#Page7Line1-1#  One of Raven's tail feathers came off in his hand!
#Page7Time1#		3.0
#Page7Line2-0#  Then there was another jerk, and another.
#Page7Line2-1#  Raven felt much lighter, and the ache in his tail was going. 
#Page7Time2#		3.0
#Page7Line3-0#  He sang: Raven's feathers, unpluck yourselves.
#Page7Line3-1#  Raven's feathers, unpluck yourselves. 
#Page7Time3#		3.0

##Page 8
#Page8Line4#  In response,| Hyena sang the opposite:
#Page8Time4#		3.0
#Page8Line5-0#  Raven's feathers hold on, don't unpluck yourselves.|
#Page8Line5-1#  Raven's feathers hold on, don't unpluck yourselves. 
#Page8Time5#		3.0

##Page 9
#Page9Line1-0#  Finally,| the feathers could not hold Hyena anymore.|
#Page9Line1-1#  He was in the middle of nowhere in the sky.
#Page9Time1#		7.5
#Page9Line2-0#  He jumped onto the fatty meat thinking that as he ate,|
#Page9Line2-1#  the fatty meat would hold him.
#Page9Time2#		6.7
#Page9Line3-0#  But as he tried to hold and eat the 'meat',|
#Page9Line3-1#  all he felt was a moist cloud!
#Page9Time3#		6.2

##Page 10
#Page10Line1#  By now he was falling fast. "Help, help!" he shouted.
#Page10Time1#		4.0
#Page10Line2#  But no one could hear him. Raven was lost in the clouds.
#Page10Time2#		4.0

##Page 11
#Page11Line1-0#  Hyena fell to the ground with a crash|
#Page11Line1-1#  and lay silent for some minutes.
#Page11Time1#		5.5
#Page11Line2-0#  He woke up howling in pain,| with a broken leg
#Page11Line2-1#  and dark scars all over his body.
#Page11Time2#		6.7

#Page 12
#Page12Line1-0#   From that day to now,| Hyena limps and
#Page12Line1-1#   he has many scars on his body.
#Page12Time1#		5.9
#Page12Line2-0#   He has never been able to fly.|
#Page12Line2-1#   And he and Raven are no longer friends.
#Page12Time2#		6.2
