##Page 1
#Page1Line1-0#    	Long long ago the Sky God,| Nyame,| kept all stories locked in
#Page1Line1-1#    	a wooden box,| high in the sky.
#Page1Time1#		8.2

#Page1Line2#  		People down on earth had no stories to tell and they were very sad. 
#Page1Time2#		4.7

#Page1Line3#  		They asked Anansi the clever Spider to help them.
#Page1Time3#		3.4

##Page 2
#Page2Line1-0#  	Anansi spun a long thread,| and climbed 
#Page2Line1-1#  	up his sticky thread,| all the way to heaven. 
#Page2Time1#		5.1

#Page2Line2#  		"Can I have the stories please?|" he asked the Sky God.
#Page2Time2#		2.6

#Page2Line3-0#    	But Nyame laughed at Anansi and said,|
#Page2Line3-1#    	"Oh these are very expensive stories.
#Page2Line3-2#    	You wouldn't be able to pay for them little spider, ha ha ha."
#Page2Time3#		8.0

##Page 3
#Page3Line1-0#  	"How much do the stories cost?|" asked Anansi.
#Page3Time1#		2.8

#Page3Line2#  		"You have to bring me three rare and fierce animals.|" Nyame answered.
#Page3Time2#		3.8

#Page3Line3-0#  	"A leopard with sharp teeth like spears,| a hornet that stings people,|
#Page3Line3-1#   	and a snake that swallows people whole."
#Page3Time3#		7.2

#Page3Line4#    	He laughed and laughed.| He thought his stories were quite safe. 
#Page3Time4#		4.0

##Page 4
#Page4Line1-0#    	So Anansi climbed slowly back down his
#Page4Line1-1#    	sticky thread to the earth.
#Page4Time1#		4.0

#Page4Line2#    	He thought and he thought,| and he came up with a plan.
#Page4Time2#		3.4

#Page4Line3-0#  	He dug a deep hole,| covered it with branches and dirt
#Page4Line3-1#  	so it was hidden,| and he went home for supper.
#Page4Time3#		5.7

#Page4Line4-0#  	In the morning,| sure enough
#Page4Line4-1#  	a leopard had fallen into his pit.
#Page4Time4#		4.0

#Page4Line5-0#  	He was furiously scratching at the side of the pit,|
#Page4Line5-1#  	but he couldn't get out.
#Page4Time5#		4.3

##Page 5
#Page5Line1-0#  	"Oh let me help you my dear friend!"| said Anansi.| 
#Page5Line1-1#   	"Just lie down on these sticks and I'll pull you out." 
#Page5Time1#		5.5

#Page5Line2-0#  	Anansi wound his sticky web round the leopard and the sticks,|
#Page5Line2-1#  	and pulled him up to heaven to show the Sky God.
#Page5Time2#		6.8

#Page5Line3#   		But Nyame just laughed and said,| "Where are the other two?"
#Page5Time3#		3.1

##Page 6
#Page6Line1#  		So Anansi went back down to earth to get the second creature. 
#Page6Time1#		3.5

#Page6Line2#  		He thought and he thought,| and he came up with a plan.
#Page6Time2#		3.2

#Page6Line3-0#  	He took a gourd full of water,| and went to the tree
#Page6Line3-1#  	where the hornets lived.
#Page6Time3#		3.9

#Page6Line4#   		He poured out some of the water all over their nest.
#Page6Time4#		3.1

#Page6Line5-0#  	Then he cut a leaf from a banana tree and held it over his head,|
#Page6Line5-1#  	and he poured the rest of the water all over himself.
#Page6Time5#		6.1

##Page 7
#Page7Line1#  		He called out to the hornets,| "Hey hornets!| Come see!| It's raining!"|  
#Page7Time1#		3.1

#Page7Line2#  		Quick,| get inside my gourd,| and it will keep all of you dry." 
#Page7Time2#		2.9

#Page7Line3#  		Hornets don't like to get wet,| they all flew into Anansi's gourd. 
#Page7Time3#		3.9

##Page 8
#Page8Line1-0#    	Then,| Anansi quickly spun a web across the opening,|
#Page8Line1-1#    	so the hornets couldn't get out,| no matter how much they buzzed.
#Page8Time1#		6.0

#Page8Line2#  	He carried them up to heaven,| and showed them to the Sky God.  
#Page8Time2#		2.5

#Page8Line3-0#  	But Nyame just said,| "Where's the last one?"|
#Page8Line3-1#  	He wasn't laughing so much anymore.
#Page8Time3#		4.1

##Page 9
#Page9Line1-0#  	So Anansi went back down to earth again.|
#Page9Line1-1#  	He thought and he thought,|
#Page9Line1-2#  	but he couldn't come up with a plan.
#Page9Time1#		6.0

#Page9Line2#   	So he asked his wife,| who had a very good idea. 
#Page9Time2#		3.3

#Page9Line3#   		Together they found a good long thick branch and some strong vines. 
#Page9Time3#		4.2

#Page9Line4-0#   	When they got near the stream where the snake lived,|
#Page9Line4-1#   	they began to argue. 
#Page9Time4#		3.0

#Page9Line5-0#  	"My branch is longer!"|
#Page9Line5-1#		"No, it isn't!"|
#Page9Line5-2#		"Yes it is!"
#Page9Time5#		2.5


#Page 10
#Page10Line1#   	Soon,| the snake came out,| and asked what the argument was.
#Page10Time1#		2.7

#Page10Line2-0# "I was arguing with my wife,"| said Anansi.|
#Page10Line2-1# 	"She says this stick is longer than you are.| But I don't agree."
#Page10Time2#		6.1

#Page10Line3# 		"Of course I'm longer than this stick!"| said the snake. 
#Page10Time3#		3.0

#Page10Line4-0# 	"I'm very long!| I'm a huge snake!|
#Page10Line4-1# 	Just put your stick next to me and measure!" 
#Page10Time4#		5.5


##Page 11
#Page11Line1-0# 	So Anansi did that,| and he tied the snake
#Page11Line1-1# 	to the stick with his vine to keep him straight.
#Page11Time1#		5.2

#Page11Line2-0#   	When he was all tied up,|
#Page11Line2-1#   	Anansi took the snake up to heaven.
#Page11Time2#		3.8

##Page 12
#Page12Line1# 		Nyame had to admit that Anansi had paid his price.
#Page12Time1#		3.9

#Page12Line2-0#   	So he went to his wooden box,| opened the lid,|
#Page12Line2-1#   	and gave all the stories to Anansi.  
#Page12Time2#		4.8

#Page12Line3# 		Anansi carried the stories triumphantly down to earth. 
#Page12Time3#		3.3

#Page12Line4-0# 	He shared them with his wife,|
#Page12Line4-1# 	and all the other animals and people.
#Page12Time4#		3.4

#Page12Line5# 		Stories are for telling,| not for keeping in wooden boxes.
#Page12Time5#		3.0
