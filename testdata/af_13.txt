##Page 1
#Page1Line1-0#		In the old days there were two people,| Dima and
#Page1Line1-1#		Owl.
#Page1Time1#		3.85
#Page1Line2#		  Owl owned the sun,| water| and fire.
#Page1Time2#		2.45
#Page1Line3-0#		Dima| did not have any of these things| and lived
#Page1Line3-1#		in darkness with his family.
#Page1Time3#		5.25
 
##Page 2
#Page2Line1-0#		Dima tried to make a garden,| but he could not
#Page2Line1-1#		grow vegetables because there was no sun.
#Page2Time1#		5.62
#Page2Line2#		  Everybody suffered because there was no sun.
#Page2Time2#		2.45
#Page2Line3-0#		When they hunted animals to eat,| they hung their
#Page2Line3-1#		meat in the trees to dry,| but it rotted because
#Page2Line3-2#		there was no sun.
#Page2Time3#		7.89
 
##Page 3
#Page3Line1-0#		One day,| Dima decided to visit Owl.| When
#Page3Line1-1#		they served food,| Dima wondered why Owl's
#Page3Line1-2#		food tasted so good.
#Page3Time1#		8.24
#Page3Line2-0#		He wondered if it was because the food grew
#Page3Line2-1#		in the sun,| and cooked in a fire.
#Page3Time2#		5.1
#Page3Line3-0#		Secretly,| Dima made a plan.| He decided to
#Page3Line3-1#		dance.| He wanted everyone at Owl's place
#Page3Line3-2#		to gather around him and see him dance.
#Page3Time3#		4.9
#Page3Line4-0#		He was a good dancer.| Owl and his family
#Page3Line4-1#		admired the beautiful dancing.
#Page3Time4#		2.8
 
##Page 4
#Page4Line1-0#		When it grew dark,| Owl decided to fetch the sun
#Page4Line1-1#		from his house so that he could still watch Dima's dancing.
#Page4Time1#		7.45
#Page4Line2-0#		Owl kept the sun in an animal skin bag inside his
#Page4Line2-1#		hut.| He carried the sun out from his house and
#Page4Line2-2#		held it high above his shoulders.
#Page4Time2#		9.5
#Page4Line3-0#		Now it was light.| Everyone could see far into
#Page4Line3-1#		the distance.| Soon everyone was dancing in the
#Page4Line3-2#		light of the sun.
#Page4Time3#		8.55
 
##Page 5
#Page5Line1#		Dima crept closer to the sun while he was dancing.
#Page5Time1#		3.1
#Page5Line2-0#		Owl held on to the sun,| but after a while he
#Page5Line2-1#		forgot about it because he enjoyed the dancing so much.
#Page5Time2#		7.2
#Page5Line3-0#		He saw how beautifully Dima danced.|
#Page5Line3-1#		He wanted to dance like this.
#Page5Time3#		5.05
 
##Page 6
#Page6Line1-0#		Suddenly,| Dima took his fighting stick and hit
#Page6Line1-1#		the sun into the air like a ball.
#Page6Time1#		5.3
#Page6Line2-0#		The sun travelled so far that it remained forever
#Page6Line2-1#		in the sky.| It gave everyone light all day.
#Page6Time2#		7.2
 
##Page 7
#Page7Line1-0#		Dima ran away so fast that Owl could not find him.|
#Page7Line1-1#		He stayed away for a long time.
#Page7Time1#		6.66
#Page7Line2-0#		After a while,| he disguised himself and went back
#Page7Line2-1#		to Owl's place.| The children recognised him and
#Page7Line2-2#		said:| "There is the man who stole our sun!".
#Page7Time2#		9.67
#Page7Line3-0#		The adults did not agree with the children and
#Page7Line3-1#		said,| "No, this is not the man who stole our sun".
#Page7Time3#		5.53
 
##Page 8
#Page8Line1-0#		They saw the man was an old dancer.| He wore
#Page8Line1-1#		a lot of beads around his body.| They were
#Page8Line1-2#		magic dancing beads and they made people dance.
#Page8Time1#		10.42
#Page8Line2-0#		It was not long before everyone was dancing.|
#Page8Line2-1#		They danced the whole afternoon,| until the
#Page8Line2-2#		sun began to set.
#Page8Time2#		7.76
#Page8Line3#		It became too dark to see the magic dancer.
#Page8Time3#		2.5
 
##Page 9
#Page9Line1-0#		Owl said to his wife,| "Go and look in my bag
#Page9Line1-1#		and fetch the moon."
#Page9Time1#		3.97
#Page9Line2-0#		Owl held the moon high above his shoulders and
#Page9Line2-1#		it lit up the sky for all to see the dance.
#Page9Time2#		5.86
#Page9Line3-0#		While they were dancing,| Dima moved closer and
#Page9Line3-1#		closer to the moon,| for he had a plan.
#Page9Time3#		5.95
 
##Page 10
#Page10Line1-0#		He took his fighting stick and hit the moon
#Page10Line1-1#		high up into the air.
#Page10Time1#		3.75
#Page10Line2-0#		Once again,| he ran away from Owl.| This
#Page10Line2-1#		time he stayed away for a very long time,
#Page10Line2-2#		until Owl's family forgot all about him.
#Page10Time2#		9.43
 
##Page 11
#Page11Line1-0#		Dima disguised himself again and returned to
#Page11Line1-1#		Owl's place.| This time he wanted Owl's fire.
#Page11Time1#		7.25
#Page11Line2-0#		Owl had the firesticks hanging around his neck.|
#Page11Line2-1#		Dima joined Owl under a tree and the two men
#Page11Line2-2#		started playing an old clapping game called Gi.
#Page11Time2#		10.08
 
##Page 12
#Page12Line1-0#		They clapped and clapped.| As they clapped some
#Page12Line1-1#		more,| Owl's firesticks started jumping around his
#Page12Line1-2#		neck to the rhythm of the clapping.
#Page12Time1#		7.96
#Page12Line2-0#		Clap-clap,| clap-clap.|| Dima tried to grab the
#Page12Line2-1#		firesticks, but Owl threw them over his neck so
#Page12Line2-2#		that they were hung across his back.
#Page12Time2#		9.6
 
##Page 13
#Page13Line1-0#		They clapped the whole day long.| The rhythm of the
#Page13Line1-1#		clapping made Owl forget all about the firesticks.
#Page13Time1#		6.23
#Page13Line2-0#		When they swung around onto his chest once more,|
#Page13Line2-1#		Dima grabbed the firesticks and ran away.| Owl and
#Page13Line2-3#		his family ran after Dima,| but he made a clever plan.
#Page13Time2#		11.31
#Page13Line3-0#		He had a bag full of thorns and threw them onto the
#Page13Line3-1#		ground behind him.| This stopped Owl and his family
#Page13Line3-2#		family from chasing him.| They could not cross the
#Page13Line3-3#		thorns on the path.
#Page13Time3#		10.88
 
##Page 14
#Page14Line1-0#		Dima could not wait to make fire.| He rubbed and
#Page14Line1-1#		rubbed the sticks.| He blew and blew the ember in
#Page14Line1-2#		a little dry grass until the flame appeared.
#Page14Time1#		9.97
#Page14Line2-0#		The fire grew and lit the whole veld and each time the 
#Page14Line2-1#		flames reached a tree,| Dima said,| "From now on people
#Page14Line2-2#		will be able to make a fire with each tree on earth."
#Page14Time2#		11.05
 
##Page 15
#Page15Line1-0#		A long time passed.| When Dima finally returned
#Page15Line1-1#		to Owl's place,| he found no one but a little boy
#Page15Line1-2#		playing with some wooden animals.
#Page15Time1#		8.59
#Page15Line2-0#		Dima asked the boy to show him where they kept
#Page15Line2-1#		their water.
#Page15Time2#		3.17
#Page15Line3-0#		The boy led him to the place of water.| Dima saw
#Page15Line3-1#		the big djaba,| the huge clay pot in which the
#Page15Line3-2#		family stored water.
#Page15Time3#		8.88
 
##Page 16
#Page16Line1-0#		Dima pretended to leave for his home,| but he
#Page16Line1-1#		secretly turned round to the place of water.
#Page16Time1#		5.53
#Page16Line2-0#		He turned the huge pot over so that the water
#Page16Line2-1#		started flowing on the ground.
#Page16Time2#		4.3
#Page16Line3-0#		Dima quickly jumped over the flowing water to the
#Page16Line3-1#		other side.| Then he was safely across the river
#Page16Line3-2#		of water where Owl could not find him.
#Page16Time3#		8.52
 
##Page 17
#Page17Line1-0#		This is why the whole earth has rivers full of
#Page17Line1-1#		water today.
#Page17Time1#		3.24
#Page17Line2-0#		This is why we have the sun,| moon and fire,|
#Page17Line2-1#		because of the magician Dima.
#Page17Time2#		5.65

#Page18Text1-0#		Story Notes.
#Page18Text1-1#		In 2003, Katunga Carimbwe told this version of the
#Page18Text1-2#   Dima and Owl origin story to Titu Mangumbu and 
#Page18Text1-3#		Marlene Winberg in the Northern Cape Province
#Page18Text1-4#		of South Africa while he was busy painting
#Page18Text1-4#   on a canvas.

#Page18Text2-0#		Mangumbu, Mahongo and Winberg translated it and retold
#Page18Text2-1#   the story in this written version with as few alterations
#Page18Text2-2#		as possible. His elders told the story to him during his 
#Page18Text2-3#		childhood in Mavinga, Angola, where he was born in 1958.

#Page18Text3-0#		Most of the episodes in the Dima and Owl myth have a 
#Page18Text3-1#		wide distribution in the extensive area of southern Africa 
#Page18Text3-2#		and the Kalahari whose original inhabitants speak !Xun 
#Page18Text3-3#		and other closely related languages, although the names 
#Page18Text3-4#		and identities of the trickster, Dima, and his adversary
#Page18Text3-5#   change from area to area.

##Page 19
#Page19Text1-0#		The 'clapping game' mentioned in our version, Dima and Owl,
#Page19Text1-1#		is still current among the !xun, the Nharo, and possibly 
#Page19Text1-2#		other communities of Kalahari San. This story depicts Dima 
#Page19Text1-3#		as a culture hero and transformer of the primeval world 
#Page19Text1-4#		into the present world. He achieves this with words, 
#Page19Text1-5#   "From now on people will be able to make a fire 
#Page19Text1-6#   with each tree on earth."
