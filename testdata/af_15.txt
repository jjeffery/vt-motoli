##Page 1
#Page1Line1-0#		Once upon a time,| Hen and Eagle were friends.|
#Page1Line1-1#		They lived in peace with all the other birds.
#Page1Time1#			7.4
#Page1Line2#			None of them could fly.
#Page1Time2#			1.25
 
##Page 2
#Page2Line1#			One day,| there was a famine in the land.
#Page2Time1#			2.95
#Page2Line2-0#		Eagle had to walk very far to find food.|
#Page2Line2-1#		She came back very tired.
#Page2Time2#			5.5
#Page2Line3-0#		"There must be an easier way to travel!"|
#Page2Line3-1#		said Eagle.
#Page2Time3#			2.9
 
##Page 3
#Page3Line1-0#		After a good night's sleep,| Hen had a brilliant
#Page3Line1-1#		idea.
#Page3Time1#			4.0
#Page3Line2-0#		She began collecting the fallen feathers from all
#Page3Line2-1#		their bird friends.
#Page3Time2#			4.1
#Page3Line3-0#		"Let's sew them together on top of our own
#Page3Line3-1#		feathers,"| she said.
#Page3Time3#			3.4
#Page3Line4#			"Perhaps it will make it easier to travel."
#Page3Time4#			1.75
 
##Page 4
#Page4Line1-0#		Eagle was the only one in the village with a
#Page4Line1-1#		needle,| so she started sewing first.
#Page4Time1#			5.1
#Page4Line2-0#		She made herself a pair of beautiful wings|
#Page4Line2-1#		and flew high above Hen.
#Page4Time2#			4.2
#Page4Line3-0#		Hen borrowed the needle but she soon got
#Page4Line3-1#		tired of sewing.
#Page4Time3#			3.0
#Page4Line4-0#		She left the needle on the cupboard and went into
#Page4Line4-1#		the kitchen to prepare food for her children.
#Page4Time4#			5.2
 
##Page 5
#Page5Line1#			But the other birds had seen Eagle fly away.
#Page5Time1#			2.3
#Page5Line2-0#		They asked Hen to lend them the needle to make
#Page5Line2-1#		wings for themselves too.
#Page5Time2#			3.35
#Page5Line3#			Soon there were birds flying all over the sky.
#Page5Time3#			3.4 

##Page 6
#Page6Line1-0#		When the last bird returned the borrowed needle,|
#Page6Line1-1#		Hen was not there.
#Page6Time1#			4.12
#Page6Line2-0#		So her children took the needle and started
#Page6Line2-1#		playing with it.
#Page6Time2#			3.0
#Page6Line3-0#		When they got tired of the game,| they left the
#Page6Line3-1#		needle in the sand.
#Page6Time3#			3.4 

##Page 7
#Page7Line1#			Later that afternoon,| Eagle returned.
#Page7Time1#			2.1
#Page7Line2-0#		She asked for the needle to fix some feathers
#Page7Line2-1#		that had loosened on her journey.
#Page7Time2#			3.5
#Page7Line3-0#		Hen looked on the cupboard.||
#Page7Line3-1#		She looked in the kitchen.||
#Page7Line3-2#		She looked in the yard.
#Page7Time3#			5.55
#Page7Line4#			But the needle was nowhere to be found.
#Page7Time4#			2.9
 
##Page 8
#Page8Line1-0#		"Just give me a day,"| Hen begged Eagle.|
#Page8Line1-1#		"Then you can fix your wing and fly away
#Page8Line1-2#		to get food again."
#Page8Time1#			6.7
#Page8Line2-0#		"Just one more day,"| said Eagle||.
#Page8Line2-1#		"If you can't find the needle,| you'll have to
#Page8Line2-2#		give me one of your chicks as a payment."
#Page8Time2#			7.6
 
##Page 9
#Page9Line1-0#		When Eagle came the next day,| she found Hen
#Page9Line1-1#		scratching in the sand,| but no needle.
#Page9Time1#			5.3
#Page9Line2-0#		So Eagle flew down very fast and caught one of
#Page9Line2-1#		the chicks.|| She carried it away.
#Page9Time2#			5.0
#Page9Line3-0#		Forever after that,| whenever Eagle appears,| she
#Page9Line3-1#		finds Hen scratching in the sand for the needle.
#Page9Time3#			6.75
 
##Page 10
#Page10Line1-0#		As the shadow of Eagle's wing falls on
#Page10Line1-1#		the ground,| Hen warns her chicks.|
#Page10Line1-2#		"Get out of the bare and dry land."
#Page10Time1#			6.6
#Page10Line2#			And they respond:| "We are not fools.| We will run."
#Page10Time2#			3.35
